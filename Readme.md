# Welcome!

Lidslate is an (upcoming) mobile [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org)-based operating system, which hopefully should have its first preview release available by sometime mid-2025.

It will feature a unique user interface called "Lidshell" which will give laptop and tablet users a free alternative to non-free environments with features like a virtual assistant that doesn't need to connect to the cloud to work.
